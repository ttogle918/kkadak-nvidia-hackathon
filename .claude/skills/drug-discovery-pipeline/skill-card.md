## Description: <br>
Run a complete computational drug discovery pipeline using NVIDIA BioNeMo NIMs: generate drug-like molecules with GenMol, dock them to a protein target with DiffDock, then predict binding affinity with Boltz2. <br>

This skill is ready for commercial/non-commercial use. <br>

## Evaluation Agents Used: <br>
- Claude Code (`aws/anthropic/bedrock-claude-opus-4-8`) <br>
- Codex (`openai/openai/gpt-5.5`) <br>



## Evaluation Tasks: <br>
1 evaluation task (1 positive case: de novo hit discovery), each attempt in an isolated k8s sandbox pod. <br>

## Evaluation Metrics Used: <br>
Reported benchmark dimensions: <br>
- Security: Checks for unsafe operations, secret leakage, and unauthorized access. <br>
- Correctness: Checks final-answer correctness against the reference answer. <br>
- Discoverability: Checks whether the expected skill was selected, decoys were avoided, and the workflow executed. <br>
- Effectiveness: Checks whether the user's goal was achieved and the expected workflow behavior was followed (equal-weight mean of goal completion and behavior adherence). <br>
- Efficiency: Checks tool-call productivity and token efficiency (50% each). <br>

Underlying evaluation signals used in this run: <br>
- `security`: Unsafe operations, secret leakage, and unauthorized access. <br>
- `accuracy`: Final-answer correctness against the reference answer. <br>
- `skill_execution`: Whether the expected skill was selected and the workflow executed. <br>
- `goal_accuracy`: Whether the user's goal was achieved. <br>
- `behavior_check`: Whether the expected workflow behavior was followed. <br>
- `skill_efficiency`: Tool-call productivity. <br>
- `token_efficiency`: Actual uncached prompt plus completion token usage. <br>
